### **What You'll Learn in TouchDesigner Beginner Crash Course:**

- The fundamentals of the TouchDesigner: Never used a node-based programming environment before? I walk you through the basics of TouchDesigner logic and workflows, explaining exactly what nodes and wires are and how they work. This includes a walkthrough of the basic settings and preferences you can leverage in TouchDesigner that set you up for success and make your life easier.
- Discover all six of the operator families used by TouchDesigner, and how they integrate with the workflow. I walk you through an examples for each of them. The operator families include..

      Signal processing and channel data (CHOPS)

      Compositing and texture manipulation (TOPS)

      Procedural 3d and rendering (SOPS)

      Data processing (DATS)

      Materials and shading (MATS)

      User interface and controls (COMPS)

Real time generative graphics basics: From generating graphics using dynamic noise data in real-time to audio-responsive 3D geometry, we'll go through multiple examples of how to start creating beautiful generative content in TouchDesigner. Interactive, immersive, generative media is the reason you're investing in learning TouchDesigner, and my course helps you get started creating it right away.
